- "My guess is that yesterday I was helping out with the Arg on Mr. Waffle Waffle stream and I figured that what's gonna happen is we're gonna be powering a remote controlled. Thing." <span class="timestamp" data-time="289">4m49s</span><br>
- "But Bungie will be doing alpha sign ups in the Marathon Discord later today. So if you'd like to sign up for the alpha, be sure and join the Marathon Discord." <span class="timestamp" data-time="425">7m5s</span><br>
- "Also chat, I assume that the way the alpha signups might work is it has something to do with your DAC?" <span class="timestamp" data-time="552">9m12s</span><br>
- "So whenever you join the marathon discord, you should get a message from a bot giving you an image that's kind of like your ID card." <span class="timestamp" data-time="569">9m29s</span><br>
- "Also for future reference if you'd like to know the faction that I chose. MIDA" <span class="timestamp" data-time="810">13m30s</span><br>
- "Yes, you can control the camera if you go to Marathon's Twitch channel and type a command in their chat." <span class="timestamp" data-time="771">12m51s</span><br>
- "If you join MIDA then you could spam the pregnant man emoji like we do in our clan chat." <span class="timestamp" data-time="1064">17m44s</span><br>
- "Oh no, it's a giant abomination run. Everyone run." <span class="timestamp" data-time="2180">36m20s</span> <br>
- "Go, go, go. Come on, that should be good. Battery depleted. God damn it. God damn it." <span class="timestamp" data-time="2325">38m45s</span> <br>
- "Everyone destroy their ankles. Destroy their ankles now. Hump the pillow. Yeah, hump the pillow real good. Your mom. Boom, got him." <span class="timestamp" data-time="2740">45m40s</span> <br>
- "This is not my POV, I'm not small. Shut up." <span class="timestamp" data-time="3030">50m30s</span> <br>
- "My batteries are not flat. Shut up." <span class="timestamp" data-time="3279">54m39s</span> <br>
